## 📦 Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamedsaied8/object_detection.git
cd object_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Running Pre-trained Models
To run object detection using a pre-trained model, use the following command

```bash
python detect.py --model <model_name> --image <path_to_image>
```

## Training Your Own Model
To train your own model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in the required format.

Configure the training parameters in the config.yaml file.

Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```
## Evaluating the Model
Evaluate your model's performance using the following command:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model <model_name> --dataset <path_to_dataset>
```

## Performance Metrics
We provide scripts to calculate various performance metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP). Run the following command to evaluate your model:

```bash
python metrics.py --model <model_name> --dataset <path_to_dataset>
```

## Visualization

Visualize the detection results with bounding boxes and labels using the provided visualization tools:

```bash
python visualize.py --model <model_name> --image <path_to_image>
```
